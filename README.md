Testing Modules and Methods in Flutter

1. Objective: Ensure the correctness of modules, small units, and methods. I want to make sure that both counters work correctly, so I will use unit tests in this case.

2. Testing Package: We will use the built-in Flutter testing package.

3. Directory Structure: 
   - Tests will be organized in a dedicated test folder.
   - Test files must end with _test.

4. Entry Point: 
   - The testing process will start with the main method in the counter_test file.

5. Running Tests: 
   - Use the flutter_test command to execute the tests.

6. Grouping Tests: 
   - Each module will be organized into groups, each with a specific group name.

7. Counter Class Instance: 
   - Create an instance of the Counter class for testing purposes:
     late Counter counter;

8. Setup Method: 
   - The setup method will initialize the counter instance and prepare it for testing.

9. Individual Test Cases:
   - Each test will be executed independently, ensuring that it does not rely on the results of other tests.
   - Each test will have a descriptive name and corresponding implementation.
   - The name should reflect the specific case being tested.

10. Expectation: 
    - Use expect to compare the current state or value with the expected state or value.

11. Isolation of Test Cases: 
    - Each test case operates independently, meaning the setup state or value is reset for each test.
    - This ensures tests do not run sequentially or depend on one another.
